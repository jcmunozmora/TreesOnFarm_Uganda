Note on the consumption aggregate file.

The Uganda Bureau of Statistics calculated the consumption aggregates
that are distributed with the panel data.  They have not provided any
documentation on how the variables were calculated.  You may use these
files, but the LSMS Office cannot answer any questions regarding how the
variables were constructed.
